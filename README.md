# humhub_autoinstall

Humhub is a cool system to create own social network or social intranet.
Unfortunately, it was not easily to install it, because it has different depencies and its not so well documented, as everyone were able to install it from the scratch.
So I chose to write a small script, which you can put on your server (I have a uberspace virtual server, so the function can depending on other hosting provider), make the file runable with chmod +x and than just  run the script and follow the instructions.
